OLTPB (Operation Lose That Pot Belly) is an organisation of ladies, mostly from Kenya, who use a closed/secret Facebook Group as a forum to help each other lead a healthy lifestyle, lose weight, get fitter and to motivate each other to achieve such goals.

It is a non-profit group with an Annual Convention being held every year in Kenya. Although Membership to OLTPB is free, admission to join and participate in the secret Facebook group is by invitation or referral only.

This newsletter, called "Time Of the Month" is where the group Admins publicly recognise and share some of the many success stories from within the group. Every month it is shared via the OLTPB public Facebook page. We trust that you will enjoy the newsletter and hope that some of the inspiration obtained from the stories within will inspire others to follow a similar path.
